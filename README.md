#Traveling Salesman Problem

Implemented algorithmic solutions to the Traveling Salesman problem. 

Optimal solution considers all possible permutations of cities and compares the cost of each permutation to find the tour of least cost. 

Greedy solution continually chooses a city that has the lowest cost of all cities that remain. 

Minimum spanning tree solution builds minimum spanning tree of graph and performs pre-order traversal. 

Dynamic programming solution finds the bitonic tour using tabular methods.
